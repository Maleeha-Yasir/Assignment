                    <h2>Personal Information: </h2>
                    <p>
                        My name is Maleeha Yasir. I am 17 years old, I belong to a Islamic religious household where I
                        live with my parents, three sisters and one brother. I am an Australian national, located in
                        Melbourne Roxburgh Park. I completed my High School from Pakistan UK studies O/A levels on June
                        3rd 2021,my spoken language is English whereas my mother tongue is Urdu though i prefer speaking
                        in English as i feel more comfortable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m more of an extrovert type of person,so it will be weird when i say that I do not have many
                        friends, I never actually found the need for myself to make friends, God has already given me
                        three beautiful siblings who basically are inplace of a friend and even more for me, my pet bird
                        is like my everything to me, he’s from a common species of the cocktail birds. His name is Kiwi,
                        I just feel like he has that sorta personality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My personal interest is in tech, i love having the latest everything, watch, phone, computer etc
                        and one of my favourite brands is Apple. Talking about my hobbies, I love reading and bullet
                        journaling in my free time.One of my advanced professions is in watercolor painting, it is said
                        to be one of the difficult types of paintings but I find it really enjoyable as high skill is
                        required.

                    </p>

                    <h2>Interest in IT:</h2>
                    <p>The main reason for my interest and why I chose IT was due to its rapid increase globally and how
                        under every new invention IT has become the main backend, for example in robotics, machinery,
                        etc. Information Technology (IT) allows you to take your career in a number of different
                        directions, and the direction im headed to is information security analyst which my main
                        interest is personally in. My interest for IT developed after my elder brother started his
                        degree through RMIT back in 2017, him discussing what he had learnt automatically made me build
                        passion for IT in myself. Regarding my experience, I did go through a programming course
                        (https://www.khanacademy.org).
                    </p>
                    <p>Speaking about why I chose to do my degree from RMIT, there is not really any specific reason,
                        but I can say that its reputation is quite good as not only my father but also my brother have
                        both done their degree from RMIT and it has genuinely given a positive output.
                    </p>
                    <p>During this course I expect to learn quite a few things for example, Ethics, legality and
                        privacy, cloud computing, mobile technology, data storage, networking, robotics, machine
                        learning and AI, security, etc. I also expect to improve my team working skills by group studies
                        and by communicating.
                    </p>

                        <h3>What these tests mean to me.</h3>
                        <p>Personality tests can be useful for a number of reasons. These tests can help you learn more
                            about yourself and better understand both your strengths and weaknesses. And while all
                            personality tests are different, learning that you might be high on a specific trait can
                            help
                            you gain greater insight into your own behavioral patterns.Whereas creativity tests
                            determine
                            how creative you are.
                        </p>
                        <h3>The influence these tests will put on my behaviour in a team.
                        </h3>
                        <p>The result on the Myers-Briggs test shows that I am a restricted type of person, so for me
                            working in teams may be challenging a bit, although I come under the category of creative
                            people, giving ideas should not be hard for me.

                        </p>
                        <h3>How should I take this into account when forming a team?
                        </h3>
                        <p>Selecting the right team members is critical. Ideally, teams should be small (not more than
                            ten
                            people) so that members can develop a high-level of connection and interdependence. Members
                            need
                            both technical expertise (including writing and presentation skills) and good interpersonal
                            skills for working in small groups.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Project idea:</h2>
                        <h3>Overview..</h3>
                        <p>A large number of deaths are caused by Traffic accidents worldwide. The global crisis of road
                            safety can be seen by observing the significant number of deaths and injuries that are
                            caused by
                            road traffic accidents. In many situations the family members or emergency services are not
                            informed in time. This results in delayed emergency service response time, which can lead to
                            an
                            individual’s death or cause severe injury. The purpose of this work is to reduce the
                            response
                            time of emergency services in situations like traffic accidents or other emergencies such as
                            fire, theft/robberies and medical emergencies. By utilizing onboard sensors of a smartphone
                            to
                            detect vehicular accidents and report it to the nearest emergency responder available and
                            provide real time location tracking for responders and emergency victims, will drastically
                            increase the chances of survival for emergency victims, and also help save emergency
                            services
                            time and resources.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Motivation..
                        </h3>
                        <p>The purpose of this research is to design and implement such an automated system that uses
                            smartphones to detect vehicle accidents and report it to the nearest available responders to
                            help counter these emerging problems and reduce casualties as much as possible. The
                            detection
                            system would help reduce fatalities due to vehicle accidents by decreasing the response time
                            of
                            emergency services. The system will also provide other emergency services like Fire Brigade,
                            Police Department and Medical emergency services. In this work we are utilizing android
                            smartphones to detect accidents and report it to the nearest available emergency responders
                            with
                            the exact location of victims in emergency. On an emergency responder side, the system will
                            inform responders about the incidents that occur near them and provide them with real time
                            tracking of emergency victims on a Google map. This will help emergency responders keep
                            track of
                            the victim's location and rescue them as soon as possible.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Description</h3>
                        <p>We can develop a system which can use Android smart-phones and OBD-II connection in a
                            vehicle.
                            When the system detects an accident,It will send an SMS to emergency contacts specified by
                            the
                            user, SMS will contain information about the accident and also a call to the emergency
                            services
                            is made automatically. All modern vehicles have an OBD-II connection installed which
                            transmits
                            data about the vehicle in real-time such as acceleration, oil pressure, speed, etc. For the
                            system to work a vehicle must support OBD-II standard. In US and this standard is necessary
                            since 2001, European countries have also implemented a version of this standard, so vehicles
                            in
                            the US and in Europe can use this system and is not available to all vehicle in other
                            countries.
                            Other than that, upgrading and maintenance of this system is a very expensive process. We
                            could
                            develop a system in which we can make use of the accelerometer, GPS and microphone to detect
                            accidents. Upon detection of an accident sends an emergency notification to the web server
                            and
                            also sends an SMS to the emergency contacts, emergency responders have to access the web
                            server
                            to find out about an accident. Their system made use of the same sensors and hardware that
                            the
                            algorithm presented in this research work makes use of, except for a few features. The main
                            issue with this system is that the notifications are sent to a web server and responders
                            needs
                            to check the web server for accident notification, there is no system for individual
                            responder
                            that responds to the emergency to track victim’s location and also the system will lack the
                            functionality to send emergency notification to the nearest emergency center in case there
                            is
                            more than one emergency center in the area.
                        </p>
                        <p>Developing a system called WreckWatch which involves reading data from the accelerometer and
                            acoustic data from the microphone to detect accidents. If an incident has occurred, the
                            application contacts nearby emergency services and provides GPS-coordinates of accident
                            location.
                        </p>
                        <p>Developing an android application that uses accelerometer sensors to detect accidents. After
                            sensing the accident, the application automatically sends a voice message to the ambulance
                            emergency response services that are running in your country. Also, the system could be
                            prone to
                            increased false positives because there is no filter in place to verify if an accident
                            detected
                            by the smartphone is a real accident or just false alarm due to dropping the smartphone,
                            etc. In
                            this study we looked at various technologies and existing systems providing us with broad
                            analysis that can help us in developing our system. From analysis we found that these
                            systems
                            can play a very important role in saving human lives. A new system is to be developed based
                            on
                            unique features that will help counter emergencies.

                        <h3>Outcome</h3>
                        <p>smart rescue system, which uses an on board accelerometer sensor to detect an accident and
                            generate an emergency alert and send it to the nearest emergency responder and will also
                            send an
                            SMS to emergency contact containing location coordinates of the accident. With real time
                            location tracking for both victim and responder the system will drastically increase the
                            survival rate of an accident victim by providing emergency aid in time. The system will also
                            provide help during other emergencies such as during fire, robberies/theft and other medical
                            emergencies. Emergency responders will be able pinpoint the victim's location on a Google
                            map in
                            real time. The impact will be quite severe as the change its going to pick up will be
